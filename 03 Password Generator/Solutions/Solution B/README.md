# üîê Password Generator - Functional Implementation (Solution B)

This solution provides a clean, straightforward implementation of a password generation system using **pure functional programming techniques** in Python.

It is part of a comparative project that demonstrates solving the same problem with two different paradigms: object-oriented (Solution A) and functional (Solution B).

## üìö Overview

This functional approach includes three standalone functions, each responsible for generating a different type of password:

- **`generate_pin()`** ‚Äì Generates a numeric-only PIN
- **`generate_random_password()`** ‚Äì Creates random character-based passwords
- **`generate_memorable_password()`** ‚Äì Produces readable passwords using vocabulary words

Each function is self-contained, easily testable, and does not rely on any shared object state.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **External Library**: 
> No external libraries are required unless you provide a custom vocabulary for the memorable password generator.
