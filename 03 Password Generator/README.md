# 🔐 Password Generator – OOP vs Functional Approaches

This project is a comparative implementation of a **password generation system** using two different programming paradigms:

- **Solution A: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Solution B: Functional Programming (FP)**

The goal is to showcase how the same problem can be addressed with different design philosophies, making it an ideal resource for learning, teaching, or evaluating software architecture choices.

## 📚 What This Project Does

The system can generate three types of passwords:

1. **PIN Codes** – Numeric-only short codes (e.g., 4-digit authentication)
2. **Random Passwords** – Secure passwords with customizable characters, numbers, and symbols
3. **Memorable Passwords** – Readable passwords built from common words, customizable by separator and casing

Each implementation (OOP and Functional) contains:

- Full code in `main.py`
- Unit-like test functions
- Sample print outputs

## 🚀 Quick Start

To try either version, navigate into the corresponding folder and run the main file.

### ▶️ Run OOP Version:

```bash
cd solution\ A
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```
## ▶️ Run Functional Version:
```bash
cd solution\ B
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```
