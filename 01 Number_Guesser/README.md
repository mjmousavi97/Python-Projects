# 🎮 Number Guesser Game Collection

This repository contains two implementations of a classic number guessing game in Python:

1. **Modular Version**: A clean, modularized implementation using functions across multiple files (recommended for learning clean code structure).
2. **Simple Script Version**: A single-file version with all logic in one place (great for beginners).
