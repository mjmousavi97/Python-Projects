# Project-Based Python Journey

## Description
This repository is a personal learning log where I implement various python projects from the amazing [Pytopia - Project-Based Python Course](https://www.pytopia.ai/courses/project-based-python). The goal is to enhance my python skills through hands-on practice by  completing real-world mini-projects across multiple difficulty levels.

## 🎯 My Learning Goal
I plan to complete **all projects** in the course over the coming months and document each of them here with my custom implementations, notes and improvements. This repo is continuously being updated as I progress.

## Completed Projects
| No. | Project Name          | Level    | Status     | Notes         |
|-----|------------------------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1   | Number Guesser   | Level I  | ✅ Done     | My first project! 🎉 |
| 2   | Rock Paper Scissore | Level I |  ✅ Done  | My first project using OOP! 🕹️|
| 3   | ... (coming soon)     | Level I  | ⏳ In queue |                |

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a separate project and includes:
- Source code (`main.py`, etc.)
- Optional documentation or notes
- Sample outputs (screenshots if needed)

## 🔧 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. To run a project:
```bash
cd project-folder-name
python main.py
```
