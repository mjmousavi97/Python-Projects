# Number Guesser Game Project - Solution 1

## Description
This solution provides a modular approach to the Number Guesser Game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user is prompted to guess this number. For each incorrect guess, the user receives a hint and their score is reduced.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter a number between `1` and `100`.
3. Get feedback if your guess is:
   - Too low
   - Too high
   - Correct üéâ
4. Each wrong guess reduces your score by 10 points.
5. Type `q` to quit the game at any time.
6. After guessing correctly, you‚Äôll be asked if you want to play again (`yes` or `no`).

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the main project directory (`Number_Guesser/Solution_1`).
2. Add the current directory to the `PYTHONPATH` and run the `main.py` script:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
python src/main.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.
